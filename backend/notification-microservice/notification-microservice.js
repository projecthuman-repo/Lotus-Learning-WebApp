//This code snippet provides the functionality for handling notification triggers in a Node.js application.
//It involves interacting with a message queue and MongoDB.

//Import connectToQueue and publishQueueService from messageQueueService, Notification from models
const { connectToQueue, publishMessage } = require("./message-queue-service");
const Notification = require("../models/Notification");

// Connect to message queue.This line calls connectToQueue to establish a connection with the message queue.
//It's crucial to have this connection set up before handling notification triggers
connectToQueue();

// Function to handle incoming notification triggers
/*A new instance of the Notification model is created using the data from the trigger object. The spread operator (...) is used to copy properties from trigger into the notification object.
A status field is set to 'pending', indicating that the notification has been created but not yet delivered.
